# CPSC 411 Spring 2023 Final Project: Quizlingo

I've updated the repository with what we have from Frank's original repository. 

Our project is considered late so we will be docked points for it. Frank said we could present Wednesday, May 10th. 

He also mentioned that there is a possibilitity of it extending onto Finals week, but our section has not been given a Finals time yet.
